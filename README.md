# LDSO1516T1G3 - EcoSense App for Android

This app was developed for EcoSense by Computer Engineering students longside it's [website](http://ecosense.herokuapp.com/).

##Overview

EcoSense is a social platform oriented towards environmental issues, with the intent of alarming people and fixing these same projects.
The app works alongside the website using it's API to post location based posts, view your wall and read other posts. The main porpuse of the app is the location based post called "Issue" that shares your current location, allows you to upload a photo and a small text aleting for a specific ecological issue in the area.

##Negative points

The time constraint didn't allow me to complete the App in order for it to do all that the website does. However the base points were complete.
